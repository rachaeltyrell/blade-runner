##Blade Runner Quote Generator

This is a passion project and tribute to my favorite movie.

From Wikipedia: "The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in which genetically engineered replicants, which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation.

The use of replicants on Earth is banned and they are exclusively utilized for dangerous or menial work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and killed ("retired") by special police operatives known as "Blade Runners".

The plot focuses on a group of recently-escaped replicants led by Roy Batty, and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down. During his investigations, Deckard begins a relationship with Rachael, an advanced replicant who causes him to question his and the replicants' humanity.

Like many movies that I particularly enjoy, there are many quotable lines. I made the decision to use vanilla JS without a database, but might release an updated version soon.
